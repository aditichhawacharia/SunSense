## 🌍 Why We Built This

UV levels are higher than ever before due to rising global temperatures. However, wearing a hat or using sunscreen isn't always the first thing that comes to mind when you're a child. By making sun safety *accessible, relatable, and kind of fun*, we hoped to change that. SunSense provides young users with the means to put the "why" of sunscreen into practice.
