# 🌞 SunSense

**Helping kids stay sun-safe in a warming world**

SunSense is a fun, interactive web project made for kids to understand the importance of UV protection—especially as climate change intensifies the sun’s impact on our skin. Built for the **TechPals Code for Change Hackathon 2025** (Environmental Pioneer Track), this project combines education, personalization, and practical tools in one sunshine-friendly space.

## 🌍 Why We Built This

With global temperatures rising, UV levels are stronger than ever. But when you’re a kid, applying sunscreen or wearing a hat isn’t always top of mind. We wanted to change that by making sun safety *accessible, relatable, and kind of fun*. SunSense helps young users learn the "why" behind sunscreen—and gives them tools to turn that knowledge into action.

Enter a few quick details—like how long you’ll be outside or your age—and it calculates how much sunscreen you’ll need and when to reapply. No guesswork.
